### Converting Speech to Song

My thesis was about making a pipeline that only needs the MP3 of a song to make any speaker sing it, provided we have footage of the speaker. For a demo, click on the image below to play the video.

### Bomberman Remade
One of my earliest games, made in a team of 5 students in our first year.
We remade the original bomberman game from scratch.
We included all the content from the original, such as the 50 levels and the 8 different types of enemies and power-ups.
Improvements all around such as extra animations, graphics, AI improvements, achievements, local multiplayer, and an infinite-level mode.
